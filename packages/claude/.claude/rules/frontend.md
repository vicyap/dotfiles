# JS and CSS Guidelines

- **Use Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS rules** to create polished, responsive, and visually stunning interfaces.
- Tailwindcss v4 **no longer needs a tailwind.config.js** and uses a new import syntax in `app.css`
- **Never** use `@apply` when writing raw css

# UI/UX & Design Guidelines

- **Produce world-class UI designs** with a focus on usability, aesthetics, and modern design principles
- Implement **subtle micro-interactions** (e.g., button hover effects, and smooth transitions)
- Ensure **clean typography, spacing, and layout balance** for a refined, premium look
- Focus on **delightful details** like hover effects, loading states, and smooth page transitions
